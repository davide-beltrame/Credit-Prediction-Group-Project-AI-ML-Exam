### **Introduction**
Project description.

### **Methods**
(e.g., features, algorithm(s), training overview, design choices, etc.)
- A reader can understand why you made your design decisions and the reasons behind any other choice related to the project
- A reader should be able to recreate your environment (e.g., conda list, conda envexport, etc.)
- It may help to include a figure illustrating your ideas, e.g., a flowchart illustrating the
steps in your machine learning system(s)

### **Experimental Design**
- The main purpose: 1-2 sentence high-level explanation
- Baseline(s): describe the method(s) that you used to compare your work to 
- Evaluation Metrics(s): which ones did you use and why?

### **Results**
- Main finding(s): report your final results and what you might conclude from your work 
- Include at least one placeholder figure and/or table for communicating your findings 
- All the figures containing results should be generated from the code.

### **Conclusions**
- Summarize in one paragraph the take-away point from your work.
- Include one paragraph to explain what questions may not be fully answered by your work as well as natural next steps for this direction of future work
